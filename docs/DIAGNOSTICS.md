Reproduce with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm run validate`, and `pnpm audit --json`.

Solidity tests run locally without fork or funded signer. Vendored forge-std source is checksum-pinned, not attributed to an unverifiable checkout revision.

These are local validation results, not an independent security audit or proof of deployed bytecode equivalence.
External RPC and quantum providers can fail; handle their errors explicitly. No unverified canonical hostname is hardcoded into the standalone console.
Changing SESSION_SECRET requires session invalidation and a wallet-owner data migration plan.
Inspect SHA256SUMS, SECURITY.md and RELEASE_NOTES.md before distribution.
